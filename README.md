### Hi, I’m Eugene👋🏽
> Full-stack software engineer and innovator
<br>

- 🎉 I love imagining innovative software solutions and hope to one day decentralize everything😜 
- 🌱 I’m currently leading a team of two talented developers to deliver a recruitment platform for agencies in Kenya.
- 🌍 I'm looking forward to contributing to current topics of interest: CI/CD, DevOps, DDD, System Design and Architecture, and TDD to create *better software, faster*.
- 😎 During my interludes, I enjoy walks, solving technical coding [questions](https://github.com/apexDev37/Algorithms), reading books, and playing guitar and board games.
- 🐱‍👤 My Stack: *'Whatever tools best justify the current problem solution.'*
